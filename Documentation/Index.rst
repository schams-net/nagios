The content of this document is related to `TYPO3 CMS <https://typo3.org/>`_, an enterprise open source content management system, licensed under GNU/GPL.

Nagios® was originally developed by Ethan Galstad and is licensed under the GNU GPL V2. No parts or components of Nagios® are used in the TYPO3 extension described in this document. However this extension makes no sense without a Nagios® server (and the ``check_typo3.sh`` plugin) which retrieves the information generated by the extension, interprets the data and reacts appropriately.

This documentation applies to version 2.1.2 of the Nagios® TYPO3 Monitoring extension.
